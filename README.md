Compared to the client-server system, the peer-to-peer system presents many advantages that make it preferable in certain types of communication. In this study, we have been asked to implement a peer-to-peer system using the Java Socket API. Implementing this design presents many challenges including I/O management, passing IP addresses, and simply collecting data correctly. At a glance, our design is a small simulation of the peer-to-peer paradigm uses 4 separate terminals, two to hold the peers, and two to hold the respective server routers. By testing our design and gathering data on message size, routing table lookup time, transmission time, and average dropped messages, we determined that, within the peer-to-peer paradigm, there are correlations between some of these values. We further explain the challenges presented in implementing this design, the differences between the peer-to-peer and client-server models, and the overall results of our study.
